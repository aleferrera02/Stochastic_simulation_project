# Bayesian Inverse Problems in High Dimensions

 This project explores Bayesian inverse problems in high-dimensional spaces, focusing on the performance and scalability of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.
 Several versions of the well-known Metropolis-Hastings algorithm have been implemented varying the proposal distribution, and their performance has been analyzed using diagnostic methods such as
 Trace Plots, Autocorrelation Plots and Effective Sample Size.
